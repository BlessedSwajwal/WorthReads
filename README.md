### Introduction
This project provides a backend API for managing curated article collections. Users can create containers to store articles, control the privacy of their containers, and generate PDFs of their container's contents. The API is built using ASP.NET Core Web API.

### Features
- Create containers: Users can create containers to store their curated articles.

- Add articles: Users can add articles to their containers. Articles are high-quality, well-written content.

- Set container privacy: Users can control the privacy of their containers by making them either public or private. Public containers are accessible to all users, while private containers are only accessible to the owner.

- Generate PDF: Users can generate a PDF file containing all the articles in a container. This allows them to download and read the articles offline.

#### External APIs used:
- Pocker API: To get curated list of articles.
- Mercury-Parser-API : To parse the content of the URLs.
